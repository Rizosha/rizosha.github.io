## Introduction
This project was a submission for my Advanced Games Programming module whilst at University. The premise for this 
project was to create a dice rolling game that can be used while playing Dungeons and Dragons. I wanted to create something 
that I would get use out of weekly during my sessions and could develop more after the submission date.


## Objectives

One of the main things I wanted to achieve was to create a launcher that grabs all the dice together in one spot and throws them in a direction.
I want some sort of explosive and chaotic launcher that will add a little extra emphasis to my rolls while playing that isn’t like the previous examples.
Along with this I wanted some sort of system to save the dice loadouts and assign a name to them
With this the player would be able to assign them the name of a spell or attack and pull out the dice straight away without the need to curate them again. 

I also need some modifier tab to modify the output of the dice The user would be able to have the option to either add a modifier to
each of the dice rolls or at the end of all the rolls without the need to calculate it at the table.
Based on the other dice rolling examples, they had some sort of spawning system for the dice which was based on a button press
My aim is to include a system which spawns the dice on the board on a button press.
Finally,I would need some sort of tally system of all the dice which considered the modifiers This would also include a display which is
half of all the current dice on the board
