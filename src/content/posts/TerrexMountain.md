# Introduction

I developed a VR demo for this project using Unreal Engine. This was initially created during my freelance work for a client. 
The goal was to place the viewer on the edge of a mountaintop, showcasing the product in its intended environment.

# Objectives




# Development

# Product Placement
In order to give due emphasis to the products being promoted, I have strategically placed them side by side on a natural
rock formation. This arrangement is intended to mirror the way these products would be displayed in a retail environment,
creating a sense of familiarity for potential customers.

Additionally, I have ensured that these products are not just static displays. You have the ability to interact with them
in a manner that closely simulates a real-life shopping experience. You can pick up the product, rotate it, and examine 
it from different angles as much like you would in a brick-and-mortar store. Along with this, the retail price of each
product is clearly displayed, providing all the necessary information right at your fingertips, and adding to the authenticity
of the shopping experience.

# Environment

I used Unreal Engine's built-in landscaping tool to shape the environment and create the landscape. The goal was to 
instill unease in the viewer when moving around, due to the visible steep mountain drop below them. By effectively 
conveying the danger of falling, the viewer becomes more engaged with their surroundings, resulting in full immersion in the world.

I also developed a multi-layered terrain material using landscape materials from the Megascans library. This technique 
enabled me to enhance the landscape's detail by painting various surfaces with multiple materials simultaneously.

To ensure that the viewers remain engrossed in the product's experience, I've strategically restricted the size of the 
play area. This deliberate limitation not only keeps the focus firmly on the product but also prevents the viewers from 
wandering into unreachable areas, thereby maintaining the integrity of the virtual retail experience.

In addition to this, I utilized a snowstorm shader to portray the snow cascading down the mountainside. To further
immerse the audience, I incorporated the sound of harsh winds, creating a more dynamic and atmospheric environment that 
effectively sets the tone for the scene.

To add a layer of interactivity to the scene and make it more engaging, I've incorporated several grabbable objects in
the scene. These objects can be picked up and even thrown off the mountainside by the viewers. This simple, yet immersive
feature, adds an element of fun and spontaneity to the experience, further enhancing the sense of realism and drawing the 
viewers deeper into the virtual world I've created.

I also made use of the foliage features to decorate the landscape with plants and trees. By strategically placing various 
types of trees, shrubs, and flowering plants, I created a vibrant and realistic environment

# Menu

In addition to the core functionalities of the application, I have also designed and developed an interactive, 
user-friendly menu. This menu, which can be seamlessly opened by simply pressing the dedicated menu button, serves as a 
gateway to enhanced usability. The three options are as follows:

Recenter - This option recenters the headset's view, allowing viewers to reset their base viewing angle. It's 
particularly handy if you need to recenter the scene when you're near a physical wall in reality.

Weather - This option toggles the snowy weather effect on and off. It can be useful if the effect is taxing on some 
systems or if it's bothersome to some viewers.

Quit - This option closes the application.

# Conclusion

Throughout the course of this project, I encountered numerous challenges, particularly in achieving an environment 
design that was both satisfactory and realistic in line with the client's expectations. Given that my expertise doesn't
necessarily lie in the realm of artistry, this was no small feat.

However, despite these hurdles, I firmly believe that the final product was a harmonious blend of aesthetics and 
functionality. The time constraints added another layer of complexity to the project. Yet, within this limited timeframe,
I'm proud to say that I was able to bring the project together successfully, a testament to my dedication and adaptability
in the face of challenging circumstances.
